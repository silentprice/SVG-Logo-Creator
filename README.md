# SVG-Logo-Creator

## Description
*  First I started with the index.js file creating variables to hold prompts fs and inquirer. Then I install jest and created an async function prompt user to ask the user a series of questions to generate a logo based of their selections. Next I created a lib folder holding the test file and shapes file. lastly, I used my README generator in last assignment to create this readme file.
